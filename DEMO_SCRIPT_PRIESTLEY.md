# 🎬 The "Priestley Proof" Demo Script
**Objective:** Demonstrate High-Stakes Clinical Integrity & Revenue Capture for Wholesale Partners.

## 🎭 Scene 1: The Forensic Revenue Engine
**Context:** You are a student in the "ValleyVet" exam platform. You are faced with a critical case.

**1. Navigate to Student Interface:** `http://localhost:3002/`
**2. Select Template:** Choose **"Envenomation"** or **"Plant Toxicity"** from the drop-down (if available, or standard wellness to show contrast). *Note: The automation works on keywords regardless of template, but the loop is tighter with the right template.*

**3. Action:** Paste the following transcript into the "Clinical Workspace":

```text
Subjective: Patient 'Buster' presented lateral recumbent after being found near woodpile. Owner saw a brown snake strike 30 mins ago. Vomited twice.
Objective: Mucous membranes pale. HR 180 bpm. SpO2 92%. Puncture wound on left forelimb.
Assessment: Likely Eastern Brown Snake envenomation.
Plan: Immediate *vital: ICU admission. Start *tox: Polyvalent Antivenom IV slow push. Monitor clotting times. Administer IV fluids at shock rates.
```

**4. Observations to Narrate:**
*   **Live Telemetry:** Notice the "Live Telemetry" widget appear (simulating the connected patient).
*   **Revenue Capture:** Look at the **Billing Vault**. It should auto-populate with:
    *   `Antivenom Administration (Polyvalent)` (~$800 value)
    *   `ICU Level 1 Monitoring` (~$300 value)
    *   `IV Fluids`
    *   `IV Catheter`
*   **Narrative Hook:** *"We don't just teach medicine. We teach the business of saving lives. The system automatically captures the $1,200 of revenue that students often forget in the panic."*

## 🎭 Scene 2: The Regulatory Handshake
**Context:** The case escalates. You discover a Biosecurity threat.

**1. Action:** Delete the previous text (or add to it) with this trigger phrase:

```text
Objective: While examining the yard, found a large *path: Fire Ant mound (Solenopsis invicta) near the kennel. Client has been bitten multiple times. Pustules forming.
Plan: This is a biosecurity breach. Notify authorities immediately.
```

**2. Observations to Narrate:**
*   **Red Alert:** Watch the **"NOTIFIABLE CONDITION DETECTED"** card flash in red.
*   **Action:** Click the **"Generate Regulatory PDF"** button.
*   **Payoff:** A new tab opens with a formally formatted **Biosecurity Queensland Notification** form, pre-filled with the forensic data (*tox: Solenopsin, *path: Fire Ant).
*   **Narrative Hook:** *"Compliance isn't an afterthought. It's a one-click forensic artifact. We turn students into biosecurity sentinels."*

## 🎭 Scene 3: The Proctor's Eye (Scale Validation)
**Context:** Prove this works for 50 students at once.

**1. Navigate to Proctor View:** `http://localhost:3002/exam/proctor`
**2. Observations to Narrate:**
*   **Grid View:** Show the grid of students (STU001, STU002...).
*   **Distress Alert:** Point to the red pulsing "Clinical Distress" card (Student STU002).
*   **Safety Score:** Highlight the real-time "Clinical Integrity" score monitoring.
*   **Narrative Hook:** *"University partners need to know we can handle the load. This is 50 concurrent high-stakes exams, monitored in real-time, with zero data loss."*
